**Why we need them ?**

In Deep Learning , Each Neuron does two important computations. One is the linear summation of inputs inclusing inputs and weights and bias. Other computation is the activation fucntion 
The activation function will help in introdcuing Non-linearity into the output of a neuron.
So basically, The activation function does the non-linear job to the inputin order to learn, train,test, and later predict for more complex tasks.

There are different types of activation fuction and each one has its own functionalty. As shown down , here are the activation fuctions that the program will draw to show each graph of different activation fuction:

Check Observation File for more observation on each of the activation fuctions.
